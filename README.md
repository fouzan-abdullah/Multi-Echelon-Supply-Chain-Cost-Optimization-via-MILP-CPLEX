### Multi-Echelon-Supply-Chain-Cost-Optimization-via-MILP-CPLEX

A mathematical programming project to optimize logistics costs across a 4-supplier, 2-factory, 8-warehouse, and 8-market network. Developed and solved a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in IBM ILOG CPLEX to determine optimal sourcing, facility location, and distribution strategy.
Key Features:
•	Modeled 5 decision variables and 7 constraints to reflect real-world supply chain behavior.
•	Built 10 randomized synthetic datasets in Excel with varying costs, capacities, and customer demand.
•	Achieved up to 90% cost reduction (Birr 20.5M → 2.1M) through optimized flows (e.g., 57.9K units Ziway → Dire Dawa).
•	Validated outputs using scenario testing and sensitivity analysis.
Tools & Skills: CPLEX, Excel, MILP, Supply Chain Modeling, Optimization
